deims-arctic-custom
===================

Customizations for the migration and settings of the Arctic LTER DEIMS instance

Place these files under a folder named (for example) arctic, which is suggested
you place under sites/default/modules in your DEIMS install.
Enable the new module, re-register the migrations, and good luck!
